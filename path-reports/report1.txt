Gross Description:
The specimen is received in two parts. They are labeled #1, "biopsy bladder tumor", and #2, "scalene node, left". Part #1 consists of multiple fragments of gray-brown tissue which appear slightly hemorrhagic. They are submitted in their entirety for processing. Part #2 consists of multiple fragments of fatty yellow tissue which range in size from 0.2 to 1.0 cm in diameter. They are submitted in their entirety for processing.

Microscopic:
Section of bladder contains areas of transitional cell carcinoma. No area of invasion can be identified. A marked acute and chronic inflammatory reaction with eosinophils is noted together with some necrosis. Sections are examined at six levels. Section of lymph node contains normal node with reactive germinal centers.
