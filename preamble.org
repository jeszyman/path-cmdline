* tl;dr
    - Bring a computer. 
    - If the computer is a Mac or linux machine, you're done.
    - If the computer runs Windows, you need to download some stuff. See Tools below 
* Tools
  - To do this workshop, you will need some kind of Unix-based command line interface. If you have a Mac or Linux machine, then you are already using a Unix-based operating system. To open a command line interface: 
    - For Linux, type <CTRL> + <TAB> + <t> (i.e. hold down all three keys at the same time) Or just find and open the program call xterm
    - For Mac users, find and open the program called terminal
  - For Windows users- Windows is not a Unix-based operating system. You will need to download and install a program to emulate Unix on your machine. Cygwin is a free, open-source program to create a Unix-like environment in the Windows operating system. To install and setup Cygwin:
    1. Download the Cygwin executable https://cygwin.com/install.html. (The 32-bit executable file, setup-x86.exe should work on 32-bit or 64-bit machines if you don't know which you have.) 
    2. Open the downloaded .exe file; begin the setup program. 
    3. Default options should all be fine; proceed with program download and install until you reach the Select Packages window
    4. Install required packages. Cygwin is a windows program that tries to mimic what a Unix machine would do. To keep the install small, it's functionality is limited. For this workshop, we need to add the functionality of several packages.
       1. Keep the default packages that are already selected.
       2. Find the following packages using the search bar and add them:
          1. git [[file:preamble.org_imgs/20180429_154850_179289uv.png]]
          2. openssh [[file:preamble.org_imgs/20180429_154800_17928wkp.png]]
    5. Click next and complete install
    6. The cygwin program lives in a folder just below your root C:\ directory at C:\cygwin and you can remove it by deleting that folder
- Summary of Materials and Access
  - All workshop materials are on Github at https://github.com/jeszyman/path-cmdline/
  - You can download all workshop materials by cloning the GitHub repository:
  - : git clone https://github.com/jeszyman/path-cmdline.git
  - Built off commands- started wtih list of commands, then decriptions, now some narrative text. It's enough maybe to follow on your own, but not yet complete w/o the workshop interaction

* Overview or Work
    - This workshop will be an interactive introduction to the basic functions of a Unix operating system. It will consist of exercises and examples to be performed in your terminal emulator using the files provided from [[https://github.com/jeszyman/path-cmdline][GitHub]]. Basically, just type the stuff that is formatted as a command:

=like this=

    - When a command requires you to choose an input, I'll put that input into <BRACKETS> like this: 

=mkdir ~/<DIRECTORY NAME>=

    - I also use that notation to designate specific keys like this: 

=<CTRL>+<ALT>+<DEL>=

    - Text on a new line implies that we have hit the <RETURN> key. 
    - Most of the commands that I show you during the workshop should be in the session guide on GitHub.
