* tl;dr
- Bring a computer. 
- If the computer is a Mac or Linux machine, you're done.
- If the computer runs Windows, you need to download some stuff. See Tools below.  
* Tools
- To do this workshop, you will need some kind of Unix-based command line interface. If you have a Mac or Linux machine, then you are already using a Unix-based operating system. To open a command line interface: 
  - For Linux, type <CTRL> + <TAB> + <t> (i.e. hold down all three keys at the same time) or just find and open the program call xterm. 
  - For Mac users, find and open the program called terminal. 
- For Windows users- Windows is not a Unix-based operating system. You will need to download and install a program to emulate Unix on your machine. Cygwin is a free, open-source program to create a Unix-like environment in the Windows operating system. To install and setup Cygwin:
  1. Download the Cygwin executable https://cygwin.com/install.html. (The 32-bit executable file, setup-x86.exe should work on 32-bit or 64-bit machines if you don't know which you have.) 
  2. Open the downloaded .exe file; begin the setup program. 
  3. Default options should all be fine. Select any download site. Proceed with program download and install until you reach the Select Packages window
  4. [[file:preamble.org_imgs/20180429_184403_17928K51.png]]
  5. Install required packages.
     - Cygwin is a windows program that tries to mimic what a Unix machine would do. To keep the install small, it's functionality is very limited. For this workshop, we need to add the functionality of a couple packages.
     - Keep the default packages that are already selected.
     - Change the View to Full
     - Find the following packages using the search bar and add them by clicking the "Skip" column:
       1. git [[file:preamble.org_imgs/20180429_184609_179288CF.png]] (The one that's 5,946k)
       2. openssh [[file:preamble.org_imgs/20180429_184654_17928JNL.png]] (The 747k one)
  6. Click next- You may get a window titled "Resolving Dependencies". Again, choose the default (Select required packages) and complete install.   
  7. The cygwin program lives in a folder just below your root directory at C:\cygwin and you can remove it by deleting that folder
* Overview or Work
- This workshop will be an interactive introduction to the basic functions of a Unix operating system. It will consist of exercises and examples to be performed in your terminal emulator using the files provided from [[https://github.com/jeszyman/path-cmdline][GitHub]]. Basically, just type the stuff that is formatted as a command:

=like this=

- When a command requires you to choose an input, I'll put that input into <BRACKETS> like this: 

=mkdir ~/<DIRECTORY NAME>=

- I also use that notation to designate specific keys like this: 

=<CTRL>+<ALT>+<DEL>=

- Text on a new line implies that we have hit the <RETURN> key. 
- Most of the commands that I show you during the workshop should be in the session guide on [[https://github.com/jeszyman/path-cmdline/][GitHub]] (not finished yet).
